# Hi, I'm Aniket Pal

I am a sophomore currently pursing my Electrical engineering from National Institute of Technology,Rourkela. I am a tech new bee and I am really loving this world of developers. To be frank I was not interested in coding rather thought it to be nerdy thing. This pandemic I started learning about stuffs and was fascinated with world of coding.
