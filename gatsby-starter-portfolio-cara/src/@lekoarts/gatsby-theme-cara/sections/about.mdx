## About

##### I am a sophomore currently pursing my electrical engineering from National Institute of Technology,Rourkela. I am a tech new bee and I am really loving this world of developers.

To be frank I was not interested in coding and programming as I never tried it and thought it to be nerdy thing. This pandemic I started learning about stuffs and was fascinated with world of coding. I am a full stack developer developed 7 websites, a cyber security enthusiast and a python developer and developed a voice assistant. I am also into AI stuff and love working with opencv. My aim is to learn everything and I know that's not feasible but still, I would try.
